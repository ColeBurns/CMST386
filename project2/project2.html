        <h2>Proposal Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Upon looking at what type of business I would most like to create a website for, and
            considering what type of website I could potentially use after finishing this class,
            I decided to create a website for a small artist to share their work and easily sell
            prints directly to fans. This is a topic that is close to my heart, as a small artist
            looking to share my work and sell prints myself, but also requires creating a design 
            that is both appealing and accessible to the widest audience possible to allow the 
            artist to build their following, get exposure, and sell prints.
        </p>
    </main>

    <section class="container">
        <h3>Client & Topic</h3>
        <p>
            I am creating a personal business website to showcase my original illustration work and 
            sell art prints directly to customers. This will serve as both a portfolio and a small 
            online shop and while it is intended for my own use, the design could serve the same 
            functions for a client seeking the same type of website.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <h3>Development Process & Engagement</h3>
        <p>
            Since I am designing the website for myself, I will research other successful artist portfolio 
            shops to inform content and layout. I will examine competitor sites, analyze design trends in 
            online art stores, and review customer expectations regarding artwork browsing and purchasing. 
            This research will guide my site’s user experience and structure.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>
            I will test the website across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices 
            (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure consistent layout and functionality. I will validate 
            HTML and CSS through W3C tools, test all internal links, ensure image loading speeds are 
            optimized, and have peers review the site for usability and clarity.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This website represents my personal illustration brand. The goal is to display my art 
            professionally while offering a simple, secure way for customers to buy prints in various 
            sizes and formats. The target audience includes art collectors, home decorators, and fans 
            of original illustration, primarily aged 20–45. Understanding this audience means focusing 
            on sleek, minimal design, easy navigation, and clear product presentation. I will create all 
            illustrations, page layouts, and product images. Stock photos may be used sparingly for mockups. 
            Content updates will occur as new illustrations are added or products are discontinued, typically 
            once a month or per release cycle.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <h3>Growth & Maintenance</h3>
        <p>
            The site will evolve as I create new artwork and expand product offerings. To simplify 
            maintenance, I’ll use template-based HTML and external CSS for easy updates. Monthly tasks 
            will include updating the gallery and shop pages. Quarterly, I’ll assess user engagement and 
            possibly update site structure or branding elements based on feedback.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <h3>Organization</h3>
        <p>
            The website will feature a streamlined and user-friendly organization. To streamline navigation 
            between pages, each page will feature a navigation bar with buttons to go to the Home, About, 
            Gallery, Account, or Cart pages. The below site map shows how all of the pages will be organized:
        </p>
        <img src="images/project2-sitemap.jpg" class="proposalImage" alt="Proposed Site Map">
        <p>
            The About page will provide the user about the artist and branches into both the FAQ and Contact 
            pages, while the Gallery page will lead the user to one of many different Piece pages, each 
            dedicated to displaying a particular piece of artwork. The user can then navigate to a Print 
            page to select from the different Print options available for sale for that particular piece, 
            add that print to their Cart, and access the Cart page from there. The Cart page is where the 
            user would complete their transaction to purchase prints, and if the user creates an account 
            then their purchases will be recorded and view-able on the Account page. If the user is not 
            logged in, the Account page will also direct the user to the Log-in/Account Creation page.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            The Home page will have a simple layout featuring a Banner and the Navigation bar at the top. 
            Below that will be a text introduction to the website with information about the artist or 
            their work, with banners further down that direct the user to the About, Gallery, and Account 
            pages when clicked. A wireframe of the proposed layout is below:
        </p>
        <img src="images/project2-wireframe-home.jpg" class="proposalImage" 
            alt="Proposed Home Page Wireframe">
        <br><br>
        <p>
            The Gallery page, like every page except for the Home page, will have the navigation bar justified 
            in the upper-right corner of the page, with the page banner and title centered on the page below it. 
            Beneath the title is a divider separating it from the preview images and text descriptions of the 
            displayed pieces. Each piece will have a 300x300px preview image with the title, description, medium, 
            and completion dates listed beneath. The page will have two columns of pieces descending down the 
            page, displaying as many pieces as the client would like to share/sell. A wireframe of the proposed 
            layout is below:
        </p>
        <img src="images/project2-wireframe-gallery.jpg" class="proposalImage" 
            alt="Proposed Gallery project2-wireframe-gallery">
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, the site will include e-commerce via a simulated cart and checkout. No content will be 
            password-protected since users won’t need accounts for this prototype. To enhance security, 
            I’ll follow best practices like validating user input, using HTTPS (SSL), and avoiding inline 
            scripts to minimize vulnerabilities in the front-end code.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <h3>Web Hosting</h3>
        <p>
            To select a host, I’ll compare providers based on reliability, price, ease of use, support 
            for HTML/CSS, and e-commerce functionality. SSL certificate support is essential for secure 
            checkout. The site will require basic shopping cart support, and possibly FTP access for uploads. 
            The website will use HTML5 and CSS3, with optional JavaScript if expanded later.  Because 
            of the heavy use of different types of ink in my work, I’ve become fond of the name ‘Inque’ for 
            branding my work and creating a corporate identity. Domains like "InqueStudio.com" or 
            "InqueDesigns.com" are both available and professional while incorporating this name to maintain 
            company branding. This results in a domain name that is distinct, easy to remember, and fits 
            the brand while also being reflective of the work being shared and sold.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <h3>Marketing</h3>
        <p>
            I will market the site via Instagram, TikTok, and art communities like DeviantArt or Behance. 
            SEO will include relevant keywords in image alt tags, meta descriptions, and page titles. 
            Clean URLs, proper heading hierarchy (H1–H6), and fast load times will help increase visibility 
            in search engines and social platforms
