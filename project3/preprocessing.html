      <h2>Implementing Preprocessing</h2>
      <p>
        Preprocessing can be implemented both client-side and server-side. Client-side preprocessing involves 
        the use of tools like Sass or LESS to write code in a more structured, modular way. The processed CSS 
       is then sent to the browser for rendering. Server-side preprocessing involves tools like Node.js or 
        Ruby on Rails to compile SCSS or LESS files before serving them to the client. Server-side 
        preprocessing reduces the browser's workload and improves performance.

      <h2>SASS Mechanisms</h2>
      <p>
        In SASS, key mechanisms include variables, which store reusable values like colors or font sizes. 
        Mixins are reusable code blocks that can include styles and can accept parameters. Functions in 
        SASS allow you to return calculated values, such as adjusting color brightness. Operators perform 
        mathematical operations, like addition or subtraction, on numeric values. Nested variables help 
        group related styles together and maintain organization by nesting code inside one another, making 
        it easier to manage complex CSS structures. These features provide more control and maintainability 
        over traditional CSS, especially for large projects.

      <h2>SASS Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        To implement SASS preprocessing, I created a file with the .scss extension, named style.scss. 
        Then, I used a SASS compiler (such as the Live Sass Compiler in VS Code) to compile the .scss file 
        into a .css file. The result is a more manageable CSS file with features like variables, mixins, 
        and nesting. The compiled CSS file is linked to my HTML files using a standard <link> tag. Once 
        changes are made to the SCSS file, the compiler automatically re-compiles the .css file, ensuring 
        any changes to the SCSS document are applied to the HTML page.
